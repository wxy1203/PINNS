# Try PINNs

In this assignment, you are required to train a neural network to predict the solution of a Burgers equation.

1. Please start with installing the required packages.
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
2. Read the codes in `try.py` and try to complete the missed code blocks (marked as TODO).
If you encounter some difficulties, you can refer to `burgers.py`.
3. Please refer to `logs/burgers_seed=0_20230705105432` for standard training results. 
It can be reproduced by
```bash
python burgers.py
```
4. If you are interested, you can try to modify the default hyperparameters to see which combination works the best.
